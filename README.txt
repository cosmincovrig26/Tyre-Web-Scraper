!! Data has already been scraped for demonstration purposes, as shown by UserInputForData.jpeg !!

To make program run:
- Create database 'tyredatabase' with table 'tyres' (use SQL script) and the architecture shown in the picture DatabasePhoto.jpg
- run main.py

--------------------------------

Things to add for scalibility/improvement:

-Ability to choose from multiple websites to scrape from
-Restrict user to certain tyre sizes
-Scraping of more dynamic websites
-Organisation and Analytics of tyre data either through pandas or other modules
-Better organisation of classes and methods


The project was made in one day with no previous knowledge of web scraping, but from my willingness to learn
and build projects :)
